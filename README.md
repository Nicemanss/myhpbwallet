### MyHPBWallet

- MyHPBWallet is a free, open-source, client-side tool for easily & securely interacting with the HPB network.

- MyHPBWallet is created by Nicemans and it is based on MyEtherWallet which has been rewritten to work with the HPB Network. MyEtherWallet was created and is maintained by [kvhnuke](https://github.com/kvhnuke) and [tayvano](https://github.com/tayvano).

- The wallet uses a sync node operated by Nicemans, running on AWS.

#### Features

- Create new wallets completely client side.
- Access your wallet via unencrypted private key, encrypted private key, keystore files, mnemonics, and soon hardware wallets.
- Easily send HPB to others.
- Generate, sign & send transactions offline, ensuring your private keys never touch an internet-connected device.


### Our Philosophy

 - **Empower the people**: Give people the ability to interact with the HPB blockchain easily, without having to run a full node.
 - **Make it easy & free**: Everyone should be able to create a wallet and send HPB without additional cost.
 - **People are the Priority**: People are the most important & their experience trumps all else. If monetization worsens the experience, we don't do it. (e.g. ads)
 - **A learning experience, too**: We want to educate about HPB, security, privacy, the importance of controlling your own keys, how the blockchain works, and how HPB and blockchain technologies enable a better world.
 - **If it can be hacked, it will be hacked**: Never save, store, or transmit secret info, like passwords or keys.
 - **Offline / Client-Side**: User should be able to run locally and offline without issue.
 - **Private**: No tracking!!! No emails. No ads. No demographics. We don't even know how many wallets have been generated, let alone who / what / where you are.
 - **Open source & audit-able**


### Users

- You can run MyHPBWallet on your computer. You can create a wallet completely offline.

1. Go to https://github.com/Nicemanss/hpbwallet .
2. Click on "Clone or download".
3. Click on Download Zip.
4. Unzip it and double-click index.html.
5. MyHPBWallet is now running entirely on your computer.

In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just index.html. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. If you are storing a backup of the MyHPBWallet repo for the future, we recommend just storing the ZIP so you can be sure the folder contents stay intact.

As we are constantly updating MyHPBWallet, we recommend you periodically update your saved version of the repo.
